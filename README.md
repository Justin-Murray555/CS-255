    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      The DriverPass project wasto create a system that allows users to enroll in driver test education and training to help more people pass the driver licensing exams.
    What did you do particularly well?
      i feel like during this course I did a good job keeping up with the model diagrams representing all the needs of the user/clients    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      I took the client needs at face value but also tried to think ahead to features or problems that may be related to stated needs. 
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      I tried to start my process by outlining the needs and the best way to meet them and then using the standart Software development life cycle procedures to meet the client goals and keep the system well maintained.
